# Business Analysis: NYC CitiBike

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis 
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City, New Jersey. The intent of this analysis is to study the NYC ride sharing service to determine the feasibility of a similar program in Des Moines.  

## Data Sources
Data for analysis was obtained from the Citi Bike website. Slight data manipulation was performed using ![python code](NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb) in Juptyer Notebook.  

## Results

## Summary
* Figure 1 provides a composite look at Pyber's ride-sharing business in 2019.  As known, the larger cities (relative driver count per city depicted by marker size) shouldered the ride volume.  However, driven down by competition, fares were significantly lower in high volume areas.  

* Table 1 provides a summary of the ride sharing business by city type.  Specific items of note include the following:
  * 63% of gross revenue from urban markets with 30% from suburban areas and the balance, rural.    
  * Rural drivers accounted for 2.6% of the total driver workforce yet brought in nearly 7% of revenue.  
  * Average fare per driver in rural areas was 335% that of urban drivers.  While suburban drivers were 238% that of their urban counter parts. 
 
 * Figure 2 further demonstrates the disparity in gross revenue between city types over time.  For each, there was monthly fluctuations, yet little movement in trend.  
  
## Recommendations 
* With potential saturation in the urban markets, focus on development of suburban and rural businesses.  
* Entice rural customer growth with short-term discounted prices or provide loyalty discounts for repeat riders. 
* Provide additional resources (drivers) in potential growth markets (rural and suburban).
